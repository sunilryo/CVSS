Generated a CVSS report (Base, Temporal, and Environmental scores) for the following scenario:

Linus Mobile company which is popular for mobile sales, is safeguarded with a firewall. There is a critical vulnerability found in the firewall which several cybersecurity team members confirm. This vulnerability allows unauthorized remote entry without any need for authentication. To make it much worse, it also doesn't need user interaction which makes it easy to exploit. No known patches are found to remediate this. Unfortunately, easy-to-use code makes it easy to exploit. This allows potential hackers to expose sensitive information, allow data tampering, and even disrupt services.

These are base score metrics, temporal score metrics, and environmental score metrics for Linus Mobile firewall vulnerability
